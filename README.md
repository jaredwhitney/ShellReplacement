# ShellReplacement
An in-development alternative to the Windows shell

Run run.bat to run the program, use CTRL+C in the command prompt that opens then press N then ENTER to exit.

In the shell:

  + LWIN allows you to execute commands (as if from command prompt)
  + RWIN opens up an information panel
    - This information panel shows:
      - the current time
      - the song that is currently playing (only detects songs playing in youtube on firefox)
  + ALT-TAB opens up a clickable list of windows
  + A taskbar can be opened by moving the mouse to the bottom of the screen
    - This taskbar can be used to connect to WiFi networks
  + A file viewer can be opened through the folder icon on the desktop
    - The file viewer opens images in a custom image viewer
